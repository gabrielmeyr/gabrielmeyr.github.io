## About

Hi, I'm a full-stack software engineer in Washington DC. I build user-friendly web applications and fine-tune websites to make them more intuitive and rewarding. I belive in test-driven development and Agile methodologies, and love that engineering can help fix the world.

When not hacking on my latest side project, I'm usually hanging out with my wife or reading about filmmaking.
